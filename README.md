# Breast Cancer Prediction (SVM Classifier) – Streamlit Web App

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts whether a breast tumor is **Benign (0)** or **Malignant (1)** using a Support Vector Machine (RBF Kernel).  
The model is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit Web App**, allowing users to upload patient feature data and receive real-time predictions.

##  Project Overview

Breast cancer diagnosis relies heavily on identifying cell characteristics such as radius, texture, perimeter, and compactness.  
Using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**, this project demonstrates:

- Complete **data preprocessing**
- **Feature scaling** using StandardScaler
- **SVM model training & optimization**
- Model **evaluation and saving** using Joblib
- **Deployment** on Streamlit Cloud
- **CSV upload-based prediction interface**

##  Machine Learning Workflow

1. Load dataset  
2. Handle missing values  
3. Scale features (StandardScaler)  
4. Train SVM (RBF kernel)  
5. Evaluate & validate  
6. Save model + scal
